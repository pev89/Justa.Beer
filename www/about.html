	<h4>What is Streamable?</h4>

Streamable is the world's easiest way to create and share video. It's simple, fast, and it's free.

<h4>How do I upload stuff?</h4>

You can start by tapping on the big blue button or by using one of our upload tools. We'll upload, encode, host, and stream your video seamlessly to all computers and mobile devices.

<h4>How do I upload stuff?</h4>

All videos come with a unique link (like this one!) which you can share wherever you like. You can also click on the [···] button below a video to see embedding options. Sweet!

<h4>How do I upload stuff?</h4>

Signing up is never required to upload or watch videos. However, if you'd like to keep track of everything you've uploaded, you should create an account.

<h4>How do I upload stuff?</h4>

For direct uploads the maximum file size is 10GB and there is a 10 minute limit on video duration. There is a 60-second limit for videos created using the clipper.

<h4>How do I upload stuff?</h4>


Basically anything that resembles a video file. If it's already encoded in a streamable format we'll serve it untouched. If your video doesn't upload correctly, please let us know so we can fix it.
